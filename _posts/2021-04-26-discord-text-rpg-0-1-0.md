The [0.1.0 version](https://github.com/lychanl/discord-text-rpg/releases/tag/v0.1.0) of the discord text RPG is here, and the wider testing has began.

This release contains the following features:
```
 - configurable worlds
 - localized texts
 - discord bot UI (single global game, for now)
 - in-game help
 - creating a player
 - locations, travelling
 - action points system, with regenerating action points
 - location-based actions
 - player-based actions
 - items, resources, trading (with 'NPCs' only, for now)
 - skills
 - monsters, fighting
```

What does it mean? It means that you can play this game on discord or locally using the command line. There may be not much for now, but it's a good start and there will be more!

And it is already much better than this:
