title: Let's go fishing - discord Text RPG 0.2.0 Release!
categories: [Discord text RPG]

The [0.2.0 version](https://github.com/lychanl/discord-text-rpg/releases/tag/v0.2.0) of the discord text RPG is here!

This release contains the following features:

```
 - Player state via active and passive state machine with state-dependant actions, visibility and requirements
 - Conditional events
 - Action visibility
 - Equipped items as action requirements
 - Discord bot admin console with prefix and channel setting
 - 2 new NPCs
 - 1 new item
 - 1 new location
 - The first questline: first three parts of the tutorial
 - Journal action, merged skills and stats action
 - Other minor tweaks 
```

The most important added feature are the quests and dialogue mechanics - with a small part of the tutorial, that shows the player around and will be the introduction to a bigger world.

And the discord bot configuration is much more powerful - including configuration via the bot itself by server admin or selected role - which brings this project closer to having more publicly avaliable tests.

Finally, a concept of possible ACII-art logo:

```
